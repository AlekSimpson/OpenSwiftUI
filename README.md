# OpenSwiftUI

OpenSwiftUI is an OpenSource implementation of Apple's SwiftUI DSL.

The project's goal is to provide a platform-agnostic interface — without the generation of the graphical user interface.

The rendering of graphical user interfaces can be implemented in platform specific (Linux, Windows, Embedded, …) projects.

The project is in early development.
